# LLM Response Generator
This project allows generating responses from API-based and GUI-based Large Language Models (LLMs).
## Usage
### API-Based LLMs (OpenAI / DeepSeek))
To generate responses from API-based LLMs, run the following command:
```
python3 main.py <LLM name>
```
Replace `<LLM name>` with `openai` for OpenAI responses or `deepseek` for DeepSeek responses.


Note: A valid API key for OpenAI and DeepSeek is required and must be set as environment variables.
### GUI-Based LLMs (TelecomGPT)
For GUI-based LLMs, prompts need to be manually copied and pasted into their respective web interfaces.
